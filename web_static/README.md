AirBnB Clone - Front-End Basics
This project focuses on the front-end development of your AirBnB clone. Before diving into a complex web application, we'll take a step-by-step approach to design and prototype each element. In this initial step, we will create simple HTML static pages and a style guide with fake content. No JavaScript or data loading is required for now.

Concepts
HTML/CSS
HTML is the backbone of web pages, defining their structure and content. CSS, on the other hand, is responsible for the design and styling of your web pages. It's essential to have a solid HTML structure before applying CSS to achieve a visually appealing design.

The Trinity of Front-End Quality
HTML: The structure of your web page, defining its elements and layout.
CSS: The styling of your web page, responsible for design and visual appeal.
JavaScript (not in this project): Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to your web page.
